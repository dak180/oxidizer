Oxidizer - fractal flames for OSX.

Getting oxidizer from git.

Getting Oxidizer from git is easy.

Start Terminal.
Go to or make a folder where you want to put Oxidizer, say ~/Source

cd ~/Source

type the following command then press enter 
git clone git://oxidizer.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/oxidizer/oxidizer
 
and a few seconds later you should get a folder called oxidizer in the Source folder.

If these instructions do not work check Sourceforge's version at 
https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Git

Open the project in XCode 3.2.X and compile.



To keep the git repository up to date use the following command from the oxidizer folder
created by git...

git fetch origin

This will update the repository, but you will still need to update your working copy to see the changes.

New commits to git are generally announced on the developers blog at
